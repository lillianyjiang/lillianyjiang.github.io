Hello! My name is Lillian Jiang. This fall I will be attending the University of California, Berkeley to study data science and business administration. I became interested in data science when I saw how data science can interpret piles of raw data to actionable insights. I am particularly interested in the intersection of data science, sustainability, and business. I believe it's essential for businesses to invest in sustainability by using data science. 

In my free time, I enjoy exploring, skateboarding, journaling, and playing flute. Check out the rest of my website to learn more about my data science projects, volunteer experience, and interests. Please feel free to check out some of my projects on GitHub add me on LinkedIn, or shoot me an email!
