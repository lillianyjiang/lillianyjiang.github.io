excerpt: 'UC Berkeley student studying Computer Science and Data Science'

Hello! My name is Lillian Jiang. I am currently a student at UC Berkeley studying Computer Science and Data Science. 
Since Data Science and Computer Science are such broad fields with endless possibilities, I love learning about new topics to see how they can be applied to solve problems. 
So far, I’ve explored new topics such as astronomy, sustainable architecture, business, education, and can’t wait to learn more! I'm particularly interested in the intersection of artificial intelligence ethics and business.<br />
<br />
If I could use one word to describe myself, it would be "documenter". 
I love documenting my experiences, travels, and thoughts through photography, video editing, and blogging. 
For the past three years, I've filmed one second of my day and kept a daily mood tracker.
I also post pictures and videos of my travels on my  <a href="https://sumptuous-grease-6b7.notion.site/Lillian-Travels-c59912917d074e9391ad1a40a3891b55">Travel Blog</a>

and post <a href="https://sumptuous-grease-6b7.notion.site/Lillian-s-Berkeley-Content-a740dd0516ce41c9b676f14509e86edf">Social Media Content</a> about being a student at Berkeley on Tiktok and YouTube.
