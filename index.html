excerpt: 'UC Berkeley student studying Computer Science and Data Science'

Hello! My name is Lillian Jiang. I am currently a student at UC Berkeley intending on majoring in Computer Science and Data Science with a minor in Business Administration. I became interested in data science when I saw how it can interpret piles of raw data to actionable insights. I am particularly interested in the intersection of data science, sustainability, and business. I believe it's essential for businesses to invest in sustainable and equitable futures by using data science.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring, skateboarding, journaling, and playing flute. Check out the rest of my website to learn more about my data science projects, volunteer experience, and interests. Please feel free to check out some of my projects on GitHub, add me on LinkedIn, or shoot me an email!
