Hello! My name is Lillian Jiang. I am currently a student at UC Berkeley studying Computer Science and Business Administration. I'm especially interested in the intersection of AI ethics and Business!
<br />
If I could use one word to describe myself, it would be "documenter." 
I love documenting my experiences, travels, and thoughts through photography, video editing, and blogging. 
For the past three years, I've filmed one second of my day and kept a daily mood tracker.
I also post pictures and videos of my travels on my  <a href="https://sumptuous-grease-6b7.notion.site/Lillian-Travels-c59912917d074e9391ad1a40a3891b55">Travel Blog</a>

and post <a href="https://sumptuous-grease-6b7.notion.site/Lillian-s-Berkeley-Content-a740dd0516ce41c9b676f14509e86edf">Social Media Content</a> about being a student at Berkeley on Tiktok and YouTube.
