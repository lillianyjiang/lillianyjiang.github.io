## Examining Inequities in Nature Based Solutions
**September 2022 - November 2022**
 <br />
- Worked with 3 other analysts from Data Science Society to examine inequities in Nature Based Solutions for The Nature Conservancy 
- Analyzed inequities in Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) in the Bay Area using Python and data from TNC’s API
- Developed a ranking of Nature Based Solutions and compared it to current measures of climate risk to identify
discrepancies in between the two measurements, which were used to make recommendations for NBS investments
- Presented findings and recommendations to a non-technical panel of ten city planners and investors
- Language: Python

## Pac-Man AI 
**September 2022 - November 2022**
 <br />
- Developed multiple python Pac-Man projects using informed state-space search, probabilistic inference, and reinforcement learning.
- Implemented depth first search, breadth first search, and A* search algorithms to help Pac-Man find food while avoiding ghosts. 
- Designed different types of Pac-Man agents based on minimax, alpha-beta, and expectimax search and Q-learning. 
- Used probabilistic inference (variable elimination, exact inference, joint particle filtering) to design Pacman agents that use sensors to locate and eat invisible ghosts.
- Language: Python

## Interactive Travel Map
**September 2022**
 <br />
- Developed an engaging and user-friendly interactive travel map, showcasing over 30 locations I’ve explored, to enhance my travel blog
- Utilized Folium, HTML, and web scraping techniques to create individualized pop-up descriptions for each location, seamlessly linking to my travel blog
- Integrated Geopandas and choropleth functionalities, dynamically coloring countries based on the frequency of my visits to provide a visually appealing representation of my travel history.
- Language: Python

## Gitlet
**May 2022**
 <br />
- Engineered local version control system in Java, using serializable objects and commands
- Incorporated the standard Java library to implement functions of git (init, add, commit, merge, branch, checkout, and status)
- Language: Java

## Multiple Linear Regression on California Waste Data
**May 2021**
- The goal of this report is to evaluate how land use variables predict the amount of solid waste in millions of tons.
- Language: R
