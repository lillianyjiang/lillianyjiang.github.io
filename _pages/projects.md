## Multiple Linear Regression on California Waste Data
The goal of this report is to evaluate how land use variables predict the amount of solid waste in millions of tons. The Solid Waste Data provides measurements on several land user variables affecting solid waste produced in 40 regions in a nine-county area of California. The land use variables include acres of industrial land, acres of fabricated metals, acres of trucking and wholesale trade, acres of retail trade, acres of restaurants and hotels, acres of finance / insurance / real estate, acres of miscellaneous services, and acres of residential land. The solid waste variable was calculated from economic models and is measured in millions of tons.
To achieve the goal of studying how land use variables predict solid waste, this report uses the R programming language, multiple programming libraries, and statistical techniques to employ a multivariate linear regression model.
