## Pac-Man AI [September 2022 - November 2022]
- Developed multiple python Pac-Man projects using informed state-space search, probabilistic inference, and reinforcement learning.
- Implemented depth first search, breadth first search, and A* search algorithms to help Pac-Man find food while avoiding ghosts. 
- Designed different types of Pac-Man agents based on minimax, alpha-beta, and expectimax search and Q-learning. 
- Used probabilistic inference (variable elimination, exact inference, joint particle filtering) to design Pacman agents that use sensors to locate and eat invisible ghosts.
- Language: Python

## Interactive Travel Map [September 2022]
- Created an interactive travel map to help followers of my travel blog visualize places where I’ve traveled more easily
- Integrated Geopandas and choropleth to dynamically color countries based on the number of times I visited them
- Implemented web scraping to extract the latitude, longitude, and description of each location that I’ve traveled
- Language: Python
- [Github](https://github.com/lillianyjiang/travel-map)

## Gitlet [May 2022]
- Engineered local version control system in Java, using serializable objects and commands
- Incorporated the standard Java library to implement functions of git (init, add, commit, merge, branch, checkout, and status)

## Multiple Linear Regression on California Waste Data [May 202]
- The goal of this report is to evaluate how land use variables predict the amount of solid waste in millions of tons.
- Language: R
- [Full Report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r5WNGwPZPRbmEzHWKOTjnHvrITZxvofNEbPzRQ4WroY/edit?usp=sharing)


## Covid Vaccine Queue Simulation [March 2021]
- Simulated a COVID vaccine call queue based on age and pre-existing condition using R. Plotted waiting time for queues, poission distribution for arrival time, and exponential distribution for interarrival times. 
- Language: R
